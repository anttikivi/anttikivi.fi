# My website

[![Main workflow](https://github.com/anttikivi/website/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/anttikivi/website/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is my personal website available at
[anttikivi.fi](https://www.anttikivi.fi). It&rsquo;s built with
[Astro](https://astro.build).

## Requirements

This repository requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18 or newer. It uses
[`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com) as a package manager. `npm` comes bundled with
Node.js.

## Development

To run the development server, run `npm run dev`. This will start a server at
[`localhost:4321`](http://localhost:4321).

## Building

Building the website equally as easy as running the development server. Just run
`npm run build` and the website will be built to the `dist` directory.
